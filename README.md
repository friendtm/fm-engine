# Football Match Simulation Engine

Overview: The FMSE is a Java-based simulation system designed to generate and manage football teams, players, and matches. The engine allows users to simulate football matches between two teams, each with a randomized set of players and tactics. The system includes features such as generating player data (including names, skills, and positions), organizing teams, and building match lineups based on player skills and positions. The match is simulated by determining the performance of players during a game, and the result is displayed for analysis.
